Version Control

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 

It helped me compare the lines of code of each file at the same time making it easier to find differences. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

It will make it easier for me to debug because I will be able to spot errors more efficiently. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Some pros are that it helps you save the work you want saved and you can choose after what changes you want to save. Some cons are that it will be more laborious to save your work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for collaboration with other team members while Google Docs was designed to be used by one user. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can find the commit ids of the changes and also see what specific changes were made by whom. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If you did happen to break something, you could easily figure out where the mistake was and then correct it. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git to write the code for this project as well as for other future projects.  
pwd #

What happens when you initialize a repository? You use git init to make an existing directory of content into a new Git repository. Why do you need to do it?

You need to have a Git repository where all the data of your project snapshots is stored. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify. The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.

What value do you think it offers? This permits you to modify files in your working directory, and allows you to commit files from the staging area into the Git directory.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
