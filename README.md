Version Control

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 

It helped me compare the lines of code of each file at the same time making it easier to find differences. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

It will make it easier for me to debug because I will be able to spot errors more efficiently. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Some pros are that it helps you save the work you want saved and you can choose after what changes you want to save. Some cons are that it will be more laborious to save your work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for collaboration with other team members while Google Docs was designed to be used by one user. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can find the commit ids of the changes and also see what specific changes were made by whom. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
